CostCalculatorForHome
=====================

GUI that allows the user to use standardized room sizes and costs to calculate cost per room and exterior home. An alternate layout allows the user to enter their own room dimensions (for rectangular rooms) and cost for flooring to calculate price. Originally created for a geometry project at school.
